# SHARE ME FULL STACK APP WITH SANITY CMS.

This application is a full stack social media application. Using REACT, Tailwind CSS and
Sanity CMS studio for the backend.

## List of things I learned from the project.

- Learned how to use the latest feature of react using vite.
- Learned how to create a sanity studio and create schemas which are documents with field
  for the backend.
- Learned how to integrate google authentication using react oauth.
- Learned how to `get user info using the fetch api to make use of the data in the frontend
- Learned how to decode credentials using jwt-decode but i didn't use it in the project
  because the fetch api was easier.
